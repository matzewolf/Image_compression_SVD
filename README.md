# Image_compression_SVD
Image Compression using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) in MATLAB.

svd_compress.m is a function that gets an image and the desired compression parameter and returns the compressed image.
svd_lena_script.m is an example script that demonstartes, analyzes and visualizes the algorithm with the famous "Lena" image.
svd_lena_live.mlx is a live script suitable for presentations about the SVD Image Compression algorithm.
Both scripts take Lena.bmp as an input and save a compressed version of it into ReducedLena.bmp.

I will extend both scripts in the future, using Information Theoretical concepts to dig deeper into this algorithm.
