# SVD_Matlab
Image Compression using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) in Matlab

SVD_Matlab_live.mlx is a live script suitable for presentations about the SVD Image Compression algorithm.
SVD_Matlab_script.m is the raw script without any extras.
Both files take Lena.bmp as an input and save a compressed version of it into ReducedLena.bmp

I will extend both scripts in the future, using Information Theoretical concepts to dig deeper into this algorithm.
